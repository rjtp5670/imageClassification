This is my personal AI project to take a bite of AI world. Honestly, I have no background knowledge about AI (And have lack of programming experience, not gonna lie). So that most of codes are not written from scratch and by myself. Thanks to my tutor, Junhee, he helps me a lot to work around, but also Tensorflow Tutorial & references with Google search. 

I has done my best adding very detailed explanation based on my noob experience, so that hope this help someone to understand the difficult AI world.
